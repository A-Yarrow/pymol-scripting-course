# PyMOL Scripting for Molecular Visualization

Welcome to the PyMOL Scripting Course! This is a hands-on, project-based introduction to molecular visualization with PyMOL, where youâ€™ll learn to:
- Customize your PyMOL environment using `.pymolrc`
- Script molecule display using `.pml` command files
- Work with selections, coloring, and labeling
- Load and explore real published structures
- Extend PyMOL with plugins and Python

> ðŸ§¬ Example structure: [8SCK.pdb](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8SCK), a KRAS:G12C inhibitor complex published by Revolution Medicines.
